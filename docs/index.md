# Welcome

*Vigiliant Crypto Snatch* is a little program that observes the current market price for your choice of currency pairs, looks for drastic reductions (dips) and then places buy orders.

The basic idea is to use the [Dollar Cost Average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollar_cost_averaging) effect in a bit more clever way. By buying in fixed time intervals for a certain amount of fiat currency, one can profit from a sideways moving market with fluctuations. We can try to improve on this by also actively looking for reductions in the price to buy more cryptocurrency for the same fiat amount.

This project recognizes two main user groups:

1. Casual users who want to try this on their desktop computer running Windows, macOS or Linux. For these users we have a graphical user interface which is supposed to be easy to use.
2. Advanced users who want to have the program running 24/7 on their own server, usually an ARM based miniature computer. For these users we have a command line service.

Go through the subsequent pages to get it installed, configured and learn how to use it.

In case you wonder about the name: Dips means that the price dives. Submarines dive. The HMS Vigilant is a submarine of the British Navy. But also vigilance means to observe.
