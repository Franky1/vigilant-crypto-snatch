The documentation hopefully answers most common question. In case you find it lacking, have a problem or want to suggest a feature, you have a couple of options.

## Issue tracker

For all sorts of issues and feature requests it is easiest if you just open a new ticket in the [issue tracker on GitHub](https://github.com/martin-ueding/vigilant-crypto-snatch/issues). This way they are structured and I can directly reply to you.

## Telegram group

We also have a [Telegram group](https://t.me/vigilant_crypto_snatch) where developers and users hang out, discuss the application, bugs and features.
