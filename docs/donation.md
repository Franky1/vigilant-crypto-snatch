# Donation

If this project has been useful for you and you would like to give a gift as a contribution, you can do so directly with Bitcoin.

Christoph has set up a  [donation page](https://5nickers.de/donate/vigilant_donation.html), which currently is only available via the TOR browser as there is no DNS for the Lightning node which processes the payments. You can make an on-chain or Lightning donation.

You will be rewarded with a nice GIF at the end!
