# Donation

If this project has been useful for you and you would like to give a gift as a contribution, we would be very grateful to receive it. We have a couple of options for you.

## PayPal

You can send money via to Chris via [PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/paychristoph).

## GitHub Sponsors

You can go to [our GitHub page](https://github.com/martin-ueding/vigilant-crypto-snatch) and use the GitHub Sponsorship to donate some money.

## Bitcoin

There is also the possibility to send Bitcoin. Chris has set up a donation page (`https://5nickers.de/donate/vigilant_donation.html`)`, which currently is only available via the TOR browser. You need to open a TOR browser and then visit the address using that, it does not work otherwise. You can make an on-chain or Lightning donation.

You will be rewarded with a nice GIF at the end!
