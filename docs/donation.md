# Donation

If this project has been useful for you and you would like to give a gift as a contribution, we would be very grateful to receive it. We have a couple of options for you.

## PayPal

You can send money via to Chris via [PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/paychristoph).

## Bitcoin

There is also the possibility to send Bitcoin. Chris has set up a donation page

```bash
https://5nickers.de/donate/vigilant_donation.html
```

, which currently is only available via the TOR browser. You need to open a TOR browser and then visit the address using that, it does not work otherwise. You can make an on-chain or Lightning donation.

You will be rewarded with a nice GIF at the end!
