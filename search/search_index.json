Consult the documentation to learn about the new format. I'm sorry for breaking your configuration, but I didn't want to provide a migration and rather deliver more new features. 3.0 Series Version 3.5.1 Fix drop trigger with percentage such that volume_fiat is actually a percentage and not a ratio (between 0 and 1). Version 3.5.0 Add --one-shot to the watch subcommand to only run the watch loop once. Update documentation and state paths to the configuration file on various platforms. Add fiat_percentage: true option to create drop triggers that use a percentage of the available fiat balance instead of a fixed volume. Version 3.4.0 Reflect change from XBT to BTC coding on Kraken. Query balances on the marketplace at startup and after each trade. A notification is send such that you always know how much fiat money is left to trade. In the trigger evaluation, triggers are moved to multiple rows if there are more than three of them. Allow trigger evaluation on a chosen subrange of dates. Present trigger evaluation summary as a table. Make plots interactive. Version 3.3.0 Emit the exchange rate in the buy notification. Add more documentation. Fix axes label in plot.

Most configuration is done in a YAML file. Create this file and open it in a text editor. We will talk you through the necessary steps and show snippets to put into. Depending on your platform, the path should be this: Platform Location Linux ~/.config/vigilant-crypto-snatch/config.yml Windows C:\\Users\\<User>\\Application Data\\Martin Ueding\\vigilant-crypto-snatch\\config.yml macOS ~/Library/Application Support/vigilant-crypto-snatch/config.yml Historic price API In order to find a drop in the price, we need to know the historic price at a given point. We use Crypto Compare for that as they provide a free API. Go to their website and create an API key. And retrieve your API key: In the configuration file then add the following: cryptocompare : api_key : 'your API key here' Marketplaces We currently support two marketplaces, Bitstamp and Kraken . You only have to configure one of them, but you can also configure both. When you start the program, you can just choose which marketplace you want to use today. Bitstamp In order to use Bitstamp, you need to set up an API key with them that has the correct permissions to trade with. Go to the settings menu and create a new key. Put this API key into the configuration file. bitstamp : username : 'username here' key : 'key here' secret : 'secret here' Kraken The Kraken Python library that we use has it's own configuration files. First you have to create a file at ~/.config/clikraken/settings.ini and insert the following there: [clikraken] trading_agreement = agree Then on the website create an API key which has the permission to trade. Navigate to the API settings: There you need to create a new API key: Be sure to select the Create & Modify Orders permission such that the program can actually execute orders. Give the least amount of permissions, you certainly don't want Withdraw Funds . You will get an API key and an associated secret. In the file ~/.config/clikraken/kraken.key you must have two lines, the first will be API key and the second will be the secret, like this: APIKEY secret There is nothing to add to our main configuration file. Triggers First you should set the polling interval that the main loop should use. It will wait this many seconds before checking again. For testing we found that 5 seconds is a good value, for production use 60 seconds should be absolutely sufficient. sleep : 60 You can define as many triggers as you would like. This is done in a section triggers . Let us show an example first and explain all the keys below. triggers : - coin : btc fiat : eur cooldown_minutes : 1440 volume_fiat : 26.0 delay_minutes : 1440 drop_percentage : 10 - coin : btc fiat : eur cooldown_minutes : 1440 volume_fiat : 26.0 delay_minutes : 1440 drop_percentage : 5 - coin : btc fiat : eur cooldown_minutes : 5000 volume_fiat : 26.0 There are different sub-types, but all of them have the following elements in common: coin : The name of the crypto-currency, case insensitive. coin : The name of the fiat currency, case insensitive. cooldown_minutes : Minutes until a trigger can fire again. Trigger strategy We currently have two trigger strategies. One is a fixed time interval, which is basically the dollar cost average strategy. For this you don't have any additional keys. The other is the drop strategy. It will look whether the price has dropped by a given percentage within a given delay . You could for instance look for a drop of 1 % within 60 minutes. You will need to specify these keys: drop_percentage delay_minutes You can specify a decimal number for the drop percentage, just be aware that it must contain a decimal point instead of a decimal comma. Fiat volume strategy There are two ways that you can determine the amount of fiat volume that you want to spend on each trigger execution. First there is the fixed strategy, where you always spend a fixed amount. For that you need this key: volume_fiat : Amount in fiat currency. Alternatively you can specify a percentage of the amount of fiat currency that you have on the market. For this specify a percentage: percentage_fiat : Percentage of fiat money to spend in each buy. Telegram notifications Optionally you can set up notifications via Telegram. This is not required, but a nice extra to allow monitoring from anywhere. First you have to create a bot by talking to @botfather . It will lead you through a couple of steps: Type /start to initiate the bot creation. Then type /newbot to create your bot. It will ask you for the name of the bot. You can just use \u201cvigilant-crypto-snatch\u201d or something else. Next it will ask for a username of the bot. This is a technical thing, so it doesn't need to be pretty. It needs to be unique and end with bot . So perhaps use something like vigilant_0f8704a83991_bot , where you just make up your own random letters. It will give you an access token that you can use for the API. Enter that token into the configuration file: telegram : token : 'Your bot token here' level : info You will need to write a message to the bot in order to open a direct conversation with it. This is necessary such that the bot can reply to you. The level specified the messages that you want to receive. info gives sensible information, if you only want to receive information when something goes wrong, use warning . See the section in running for more details. If the Telegram bot token is set up correctly, you will receive messages like this: The severity of messages is color-coded with an emoji according to this mapping: Symbol Severity \ud83d\udd34 Critical \ud83d\udfe0 Error \ud83d\udfe1 Warning \ud83d\udfe2 Info \ud83d\udd35 Debug The logging level is set to Info by default.

If you have installed it system-wide, you can just directly call it. Otherwise you might have to add ~/.local/bin to your PATH variable. With the --help option you will see an up-to-date list of options. The general structure of a call is this: vigilant-crypto-snatch [general options] subcommand [subcommand options] The general options are the following: --loglevel : The program can emit a lot of status output while running. You can specify a log level with --loglevel LEVEL , where LEVEL can be critical , error , warning , info or debug . The info level is the default and does not fill the terminal with tons of output. You can set it to debug if you want to have more output and want to diagnose your triggers. Subcommand watch The main command is watch . It will monitor the market and place buy orders. There are a couple of command line options: --marketplace MARKETPLACE : We support two marketplaces, you can select either bitstamp or kraken . --keepalive : The program handles various error cases. Sometimes there are exceptions that we haven't encountered yet. When you use the watch subcommand in production, you can specify this option. It will catch any exception and just report it. Please open a ticket when you encounter a new exception type. --one-shot : One execute one iteration of the watch loop. This way one can call the program periodically with an external scheduler like Cron. When you want to quit, just press Ctrl + C . All historical price data and performed transactions will be stored in a SQLite database at ~/.local/share/vigilant-crypto-snatch/db.sqlite . We sometimes change the database format between major releases. In that case it is easiest to delete the database and let the script create the new one. As there are only so few users, we don't offer proper database migrations. An example for running the script with log level info on Kraken: vigilant-crypto-snatch --loglevel info watch --marketplace kraken --keepalive Nonce rejections with Kraken If you happen to get nonce errors with the Kraken marketplace, consider using less triggers for it, or modifying your API key according to their guide Subcommand evaluate It is not inherently clear how triggers should be set. There are multiple variables that have to be tuned for each trigger: Time delay Cooloff (currently the same as time delay) Drop percentage Fiat volume We can try to verify a given strategy using historical data. We can also use the historical data to get an idea of a good strategy. Then we just simulate the given triggers and see how they perform. We provide a fun experimentation interface which is built with Streamlit and runs directly in your browser. This interface can be started using the evaluate subcommand without any additional parameters: vigilant-crypto-snatch evaluate You can then select a crypto and a fiat currency to use for the analysis. Then you can just switch between the various tools that are offered. These are described below. Possible errors It might be possible that you cannot start the Streamlit interface. The most basic error could be an ImportError saying that the package altair or streamlit could not be imported. In that case you haven't installed the evaluation extra. See the installation instructions on the front page. While starting it, you might get an error about too many files connected via inotify. In this case you need to create a file at .streamlit/config.toml and give it this content: [server] fileWatcherType = \"none\" Price tool Here you can just see the prices that we got from the historical API. This is nothing special, just a plot. These plots are slightly interactive, so you can make them fullscreen and they will render with higher quality. Trigger simulation tool You simulate triggers on historical data. You can limit the evaluation data to a given range. Unfortunately Streamlit doesn't support a range slider yet, so the numbers don't make so much sense. The actual date is shown right below and will be updated as you move the slider. You can simulate as many triggers as you like. Set the number that you want and then just select the type of trigger and tune the parameters to your liking. It will give you a summary table looks like this: You can make this table full screen and also sort by any column. Just click on a column header and it will sort. You will also get a plot which shows the amount of money you have invested as well as the value of the crypto assets aquired. With this you can get a sense on the gains. The plot is interactive, you can pan and zoom with the mouse. You also have a table with the trades that were performed. In case the trigger has not been executed once, you will of course get a message. Drop survey tool Fiddling with individual triggers can be informative, but a more meta view could be very helpful. For this all sorts of drop triggers are performed, with a grid of various delays and various drop percentages. You can control the ranges of both with two-way sliders. Each time such a trigger is executed a fixed unit of fiat currency is invested. At the end of the time period the amount of crypto currency is normalized by the amount of fiat currency spent. This will show the most efficient triggers. It doesn't show how often these triggers have been used, or how much crypto currency you will have in the end. In the resulting heat map you can see colored areas where the most gains are in a dark red. In regions where the trigger has never been executed, you will just see black. These regions indicate that there was no such drop in the period looked at. Likely there will be one really dark area. This is an artefact from a single large drop in the past three months. Of course this is the best drop trigger for that particluar period, but it does not really generalize. So be wary that different historical periods look differently. Use this plot to get a general sense of fluctuations in the market and which triggers would fire often and form a good base strategy. In the above image, having a trigger at around 10 % and 24 hours delay seems to be a reasonable choice. You might still want to include some really ambitious triggers such that you can realize large gains. For instance having one for 25 % within 48 hours could be a good idea.","title":"Usage"},{"location":"running/#usage","text":"The program has a hierarchical command line interface with multiple subcommands. If you have installed it system-wide, you can just directly call it. Otherwise you might have to add ~/.local/bin to your PATH variable. With the --help option you will see an up-to-date list of options. The general structure of a call is this: vigilant-crypto-snatch [general options] subcommand [subcommand options] The general options are the following: --loglevel : The program can emit a lot of status output while running. You can specify a log level with --loglevel LEVEL , where LEVEL can be critical , error , warning , info or debug . The info level is the default and does not fill the terminal with tons of output. You can set it to debug if you want to have more output and want to diagnose your triggers.","title":"Usage"},{"location":"running/#subcommand-watch","text":"The main command is watch . It will monitor the market and place buy orders. There are a couple of command line options: --marketplace MARKETPLACE : We support two marketplaces, you can select either bitstamp or kraken . --keepalive : The program handles various error cases. Sometimes there are exceptions that we haven't encountered yet. When you use the watch subcommand in production, you can specify this option. It will catch any exception and just report it. Please open a ticket when you encounter a new exception type. --one-shot : One execute one iteration of the watch loop. This way one can call the program periodically with an external scheduler like Cron. When you want to quit, just press Ctrl + C . All historical price data and performed transactions will be stored in a SQLite database at ~/.local/share/vigilant-crypto-snatch/db.sqlite . We sometimes change the database format between major releases. In that case it is easiest to delete the database and let the script create the new one. As there are only so few users, we don't offer proper database migrations. An example for running the script with log level info on Kraken: vigilant-crypto-snatch --loglevel info watch --marketplace kraken --keepalive","title":"Subcommand watch"},{"location":"running/#nonce-rejections-with-kraken","text":"If you happen to get nonce errors with the Kraken marketplace, consider using less triggers for it, or modifying your API key according to their guide","title":"Nonce rejections with Kraken"},{"location":"running/#subcommand-evaluate","text":"It is not inherently clear how triggers should be set. There are multiple variables that have to be tuned for each trigger: Time delay Cooloff (currently the same as time delay) Drop percentage Fiat volume We can try to verify a given strategy using historical data. We can also use the historical data to get an idea of a good strategy. Then we just simulate the given triggers and see how they perform. We provide a fun experimentation interface which is built with Streamlit and runs directly in your browser. This interface can be started using the evaluate subcommand without any additional parameters: vigilant-crypto-snatch evaluate You can then select a crypto and a fiat currency to use for the analysis. Then you can just switch between the various tools that are offered. These are described below.","title":"Subcommand evaluate"},{"location":"running/#possible-errors","text":"It might be possible that you cannot start the Streamlit interface. The most basic error could be an ImportError saying that the package altair or streamlit could not be imported. In that case you haven't installed the evaluation extra.

You can limit the evaluation data to a given range. Unfortunately Streamlit doesn't support a range slider yet, so the numbers don't make so much sense. The actual date is shown right below and will be updated as you move the slider. You can simulate as many triggers as you like. Set the number that you want and then just select the type of trigger and tune the parameters to your liking. It will give you a summary table looks like this: You can make this table full screen and also sort by any column. Just click on a column header and it will sort. You will also get a plot which shows the amount of money you have invested as well as the value of the crypto assets aquired. With this you can get a sense on the gains. The plot is interactive, you can pan and zoom with the mouse. You also have a table with the trades that were performed.

For this all sorts of drop triggers are performed, with a grid of various delays and various drop percentages. You can control the ranges of both with two-way sliders. Each time such a trigger is executed a fixed unit of fiat currency is invested. At the end of the time period the amount of crypto currency is normalized by the amount of fiat currency spent. This will show the most efficient triggers. It doesn't show how often these triggers have been used, or how much crypto currency you will have in the end.
