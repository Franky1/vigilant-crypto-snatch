Pseudo code example for 1h

if {1 - current_price divided by price_one_hour_ago >= 0.05}

  trigger market buy via POST
  
  https://www.bitstamp.net/api/v2/buy/market/{currency_pair}/
 
  Request parameters
  key	API key.
  signature	Signature.
  nonce	Nonce.
  amount	Amount. amount measured in BTC, so would be Amount Euro you wish to buy for (x_euro) divided by current_price --> x_euro/current_price
  
  
  
 
 
else
  continue to next if
  


after all ifs, wait 1 min to trigger the next run



thoughts on safty mechanism:

  id	Order ID.
  datetime	Date and time.
  type	0 (buy) or 1 (sell).
  price	Price.
  amount	Amount.
  
  Safty mechanism: if this if condition is executed it should not be execuded for the next x runs because the order would then be triggered every minute but we only want one order!
  we can probably write the responses of orders in a DB (enhanced with our parameters like 0.05 dip 1h) and check for orders during the last x days and then skip those if conditions
