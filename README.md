 # Vigilant Crypto Snatch

A little program that observes the current market price for the BTC/EUR pair
and looks for drastic reductions (dips). In these cases the program will place
a buy order.

In case you wonder about the name: Dips means that the price dives. Submarines
dive. The HMS Vigilant is a submarine. But also vigilance means to observe.
Yeah â€¦

      trading_agreement=agree
3) create file kraken.key . The first line is the API key and the second the secret. Example:
